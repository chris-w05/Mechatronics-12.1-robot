Prerequisites
Before generating documentation, install:
  Doxygen
  Graphviz (required for UML and class diagrams)

Ubuntu / Debian
  sudo apt install doxygen graphviz
Windows
  Download installers from:
  https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html
  https://graphviz.org/download/

Generating Documentation
From the root of the project directory, run:
doxygen Doxyfile
This will generate a new folder:
html/
